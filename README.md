## Problem Statement:

Analyzing the relationship between crude oil and refined product prices is crucial for gaining insights into market trends, demand-supply dynamics, and price drivers within the energy sector. This analysis aids in making informed decisions related to investments, trading activities, and long-term strategic planning. Moreover, accurate forecasting of future price movements enables stakeholders to anticipate market trends and adjust their strategies accordingly. Understanding the interplay between these prices across various global markets provides policymakers with valuable information about potential market distortions, vulnerabilities in the supply chain, and the effectiveness of regulatory interventions. Consequently, this knowledge facilitates the formulation of appropriate policies and regulations aimed at ensuring market stability, energy security, and sustainable development. Therefore, studying the relationships between crude oil prices and their refined products worldwide in energy commodity trading ultimately contributes to the efficient functioning of the energy market and broader economic stability.

## Literature Review

### Introduction:
Crude oil is an important resource for the world economy. It's evident that the Crude oil in the international market is playing a pivotal role in the rapid economic progress over the past few decades (Zhang 2374). There are many studies in literature that examine the relationship between crude oil prices and various macroeconomic variables (Zarour and Abu 145, Aguiar-Conraria et al. 645).
### Key Figures in the Field:
Robert C. Merton's work on option pricing models and their application to energy finance is considered as one of the earliest works on energy finance. His work has paved the way in understanding the pricing dynamics and risk management strategies in energy markets (Merton and Robert 178). 
In literature correlation analysis can be found which was used to assess the relationship between crude oil prices and their refined products. It's commonly found that there exists a strong correlation between crude oil and its derivatives, such as gasoline, diesel, and heating oil. However, the strength and direction of these correlations may vary across different markets and time periods. Figure 1 shows the price index of crude oil vs petroleum products. Four major petroleum products were used in the study. The relationship proves how major petroleum products track very closely with crude oil prices over a long period.

There are studies that indicate energy markets are increasingly integrated globally, leading to greater interconnectedness between prices in different regions. This integration is influenced by factors such as globalization, technological advancements in trading platforms, and geopolitical events. For instance, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the relationship between crude oil prices and gasoline prices and especially the relationship between crude oil and diesel fuel prices appears to have changed. Figure 2 (a) and (b) show the relationship of crude oil prices and US retail gas price and highway diesel fuel price respectively.  These figures highlight the impact of crude oil and diesel fuel prices during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It is clear that the relationship between diesel fuel and crude oil has increased.

Some studies have also examined the spillover effects of volatility between crude oil prices and their refined products. Volatility spillovers can occur due to factors such as supply-demand dynamics, macroeconomic indicators, geopolitical tensions, and speculative trading activities. Impact of GEPU on oil price fluctuation is shown in this figure 3. It is clear that when there is a sharp increase in the GEPU index (during the international financial crisis of 2008–2009 and European sovereign debt crisis of 2011–2012), the crude oil price also rises sharply (Feng et al 2).

Economic indicators, such as GDP growth, inflation rates, interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have been found to influence energy product prices. Researchers have analyzed the relationship between these indicators and energy prices to assess market dynamics and forecasting accuracy. Figure shows  oil prices and annual changes in world-GDP. Each spike in oil prices was followed by a sharp drop in world GDP growth.

Research Trends and Common Findings:
Over the past years, many studies  highlight the complex relationships between crude oil prices and their refined products. Studies often observe strong correlations but also significant divergences influenced by factors such as supply chain disruptions, refining capacity, geopolitical tensions, and regulatory changes (Ederington et al. 13).
In addition, time series analysis of energy prices reveals distinct temporal patterns and distributional characteristics. These analyses often showcase the presence of volatility clustering, mean-reversion tendencies, and long-term trends in energy markets (Fattouh et al. 29).

#### Research gap:
However, the relationship between crude oil prices and their refined products across different global markets in energy commodity trading is complicated. Understanding these relations are essential for effective decision-making and risk management in the energy industry. 
Crude oil serves as the primary input for the production of refined petroleum products including gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. Understanding the relationship between crude oil prices and refined product prices helps stakeholders in the energy industry manage their supply chains efficiently. Changes in crude oil prices directly affect the production costs of refined products, influencing pricing decisions to maintain competitiveness and profitability in the market. Energy companies, traders, and investors face various risks associated with fluctuations in crude oil and refined product prices, including market volatility, supply disruptions, and geopolitical tensions. Understanding the dynamics between crude oil and refined product prices enables stakeholders to implement effective risk management strategies, such as hedging with derivatives contracts, to mitigate exposure to price volatility and protect against financial losses.
Analyzing the relationship between crude oil and refined product prices provides valuable insights into market trends, demand-supply dynamics, and price drivers in the energy sector. This is valuable  to make informed decisions regarding investments, trading activities, and long-term strategic planning. Furthermore, accurate forecasting of future price movements helps stakeholders anticipate market trends and adjust their strategies accordingly. Understanding the relationships between these prices across different global markets informs policymakers about potential market distortions, supply chain vulnerabilities, and the effectiveness of regulatory interventions. This helps in formulating appropriate policies and regulations to ensure market stability, energy security, and sustainable development.
Therefore studying the relationships between crude oil prices and their refined products worldwide in energy commodity trading  ultimately contributes to the efficient functioning of the energy market and broader economic stability.
Even Though, multivariate techniques and statistical analysis have been commonly used to identify the patterns of  crude oil prices and their refined products, there is a lack of comprehensive assessments in this regard. The challenges identified in such studies are  availability and quality of data, geopolitical factors, macroeconomic variables, regulatory frameworks etc.
Data collection processes may be less standardized leading to inconsistencies and gaps in the data. Obtaining reliable and consistent data on crude oil production, refining capacities and market demand from countries can be challenging. Energy markets vary significantly in terms of market structures, regulatory frameworks, and industry dynamics across different geographical regions.  The energy market in some countries may be highly fragmented, with numerous producers, refiners, and distributors while in other countries may have state-controlled energy sectors dominated by a few major players(Claes and Harald 53). Additionally, geopolitical factors can significantly impact energy markets and price relationships. Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East can lead to supply disruptions and volatility in crude oil prices, which may have ripple effects on refined product prices globally (Carlson and Nicholas 10). Price relationships in energy markets are also influenced by broader macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth, inflation rates, exchange rates, and interest rates. Variations in regulatory frameworks across regions can create disparities in energy prices and market structures. Government interventions such as fuel subsidies in certain countries can distort price relationships and market dynamics (Fattouh et al. 8). 

#### Cutting edge within the field:
Several robust frameworks currently available for analyzing and predicting the dynamic correlations between crude oil prices and their refined products across various global markets. These frameworks often integrate advanced statistical methodologies and econometric techniques to provide insights into market dynamics. 
Vector Error Correction Models (VECM) is a widely used econometric framework for analyzing the long-term and short-term relationships between multiple time series variables. In energy markets, VECM models can capture the dynamic interactions between crude oil prices and refined product prices across different regions(Lütkepohl and Helmut). Multivariate GARCH Models models extend the univariate GARCH framework to multiple time series variables. They are suitable for capturing the time-varying volatility and conditional correlations between crude oil prices and refined product prices in different markets(Engle and Robert 339).  Factor Models and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) techniques are employed to extract common factors or latent variables from a large set of correlated time series data. In energy markets, factor models can identify common trends, shocks, and underlying factors driving the co-movements of crude oil and refined product prices across different regions(He et al 11). In energy markets, Bayesian methods can be used to estimate dynamic correlations, structural parameters, and uncertainty measures associated with crude oil and refined product prices (Zhang and Yunyi). By accounting for parameter uncertainty and model misspecification, Bayesian econometrics enhances the robustness and reliability of inference in empirical analyses.

#### Gap Identification and Proposed Intervention:
The lack of a standardized approach to analyzing energy product price relationships across global markets has led to fragmented analyses and inefficiencies in decision-making processes within the energy trading industry. Bridging this gap requires the development and adoption of robust frameworks that integrate theoretical insights with practical applications. This project aims to bridge this gap by developing a standardized framework for analyzing energy product price relationships. 
Multivariate Techniques for Price Relationship Analysis can be used effectively in this regard. Recent advancements in statistical methodologies have enabled more sophisticated analysis of price relationships in energy markets. Techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are gaining prominence for their ability to capture the multidimensional nature of energy price dynamics (Aloui et al 430).
Visualizing time series data for energy product prices across different markets can help identify trends, seasonal patterns, and outliers. Quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots can be used to assess the distributional characteristics of energy product prices in different markets. By comparing the quantiles of observed prices with those of a theoretical distribution, the deviations from normality can be assessed. Moreover, by including EDA techniques it is expected to enhance the robustness of the framework by providing a comprehensive understanding of the data characteristics and facilitating data-driven decision-making in the energy trading industry.
By integrating advanced statistical methodologies, time series analysis, and economic insights, this research seeks to provide practical solutions for decision-making and risk management within the energy trading sector, thereby contributing to the knowledge base of energy finance and economics.

### Competitor Analysis

Case Study: He, Mengxi, et al. "Forecasting crude oil prices: A scaled PCA approach." This paper annotated as ‘Paper 1’ was taken for Competitor analysis with our proposed research annotated as ‘Paper 2’. On doing the SWOT analysis of both the researches, here are the following findings:
